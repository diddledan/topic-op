# WordPress.org Topic Original Poster

## About the project

This is a userscript, used with TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey, to highlight the user that created the currently viewed support topic on WordPress.org

This is done by adding a badge with the title `OP` next to their username, making it easy to distinguish.

## Installation

To install, open `/src/wordpress-topics-op.user.js` and hit the Raw button. TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey will take over from there.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, bugreports, suggestions and even pull requests! No limitations, shoot for the stars!

The project uses no fancy build procedures, it's all JavaScript and the source is in the `src/` directory
